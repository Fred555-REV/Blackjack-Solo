        //hit seems to be working drawing one
        //split seems to work, sometimes
        //TODO add logic to split only when allowed by rules

        //standing changes hand
        //but the logic for standing seems to not be working

        //TODO fix split decks making stand not work
        // or maybe change hands is not working properly
